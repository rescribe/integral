# rescribe.xyz/integralimg package

This package contains methods and structures for dealing with
Integral Images, aka Summed Area Tables. These are structures
which precompute the sum of pixels to the left and above each
pixel, which can make several common image processing
operations much faster.

This is a Go package, and can be installed in the standard go way,
by running `go get rescribe.xyz/integralimg` and documentation
can be read with the `go doc` command or online at
<https://pkg.go.dev/rescribe.xyz/integralimg>.
